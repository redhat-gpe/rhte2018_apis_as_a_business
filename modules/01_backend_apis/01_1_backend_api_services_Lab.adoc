== Introduction

In this lab, you will be introduced to the 2 backend APIs, and will seed some sample data to be used for the labs.

image::images/api-usecase-hld-lab1.jpg[]

.Goals

* Access the Mock *Driver Service* on Microcks
* Seed and test access to sample data for the mock *Driver Service*
* Update the *Driver Service* API specification in *Apicurio Studio* 
* Download the *Swagger* definition of the *Driver Service* API
* Access the backend *Insurance Quote Calculation* API on Red Hat Decision Manager
* Verify API access to the *Insurance Quote Calculation* API.


== Mock _Driver Service_

=== Introduction

A mock service for verifying Driver details is running on Microcks. There is a single instance of Microcks, so this is a common service for all the users in the lab. 

=== Verify Mock Service

. Open the browser tab where you logged in to *Microcks*.
. Verify that you have access to the *Driver Service* API
+
image::images/microcks-driver-service.png[]

. Click on *Details*.
. You will see the list of supported operations for the API.
+ 
image::images/microcks-driver-service-details.png[]

. Click on the **Resources** button. You should see a few mock resources previously created.
+
image::images/microcks-resources.png[]

. In a terminal window, you can execute the following *curl* command to add your resources:
+
----
curl -X POST \
  http://microcks.$OCP_SUFFIX/dynarest/Driver%20Service/1.0/Driver/ \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"driverID": 100, "firstName": "Jack", "lastName": "Ryan", "fines": 3, "validLicense": true}'

----

. Go back to the Microcks console and check that your resources are added.
+
NOTE: As this is a shared environment, you will notice that resources created by all users are showing up in the list. Provide unique name, driverId & details for your resource.

. Note the *id* of the resource created. Copy the id to a text editor for use later in the lab.
+
image::images/microcks-resources-id.png[]

. Close the *Resources* window.
. In a terminal window, you can execute a *curl* command to GET your resource:
+
----
$ curl http://microcks.$OCP_SUFFIX/dynarest/Driver%20Service/1.0/Driver/:id
{ "driverID" : 333, "firstName" : "Albert", "lastName" : "Johson", "fines" : 4, "validLicense" : false, "id" : "5b89722a368c02000199a1e3" }
----
+
NOTE: Replace *:id* above with the ID of the resource you have created.

. Right-click on the *Swagger 2.0 spec* link, click on *copy link address* and paste it in a text editor (you will need it later).


Congratulations, your Mock service is running correctly.

=== Update Driver Service Swagger Spec

IMPORTANT: The APICURIO studio requires a Web Socket connection to the service, which is NOT WORKING in the event Wifi. Hence, please skip the below lab and proceed to the next section. 

. Open the browser tab where you logged in to *Apicurio Studio*.
. Click on the** Import API** button.  
. Enter the URL copied in the previous step.

. Click on the *Import API* button.
+
